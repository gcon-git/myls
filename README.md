## About this project

The function in this project takes an object and returns the output of `dir()` in a table/matrix format (see file *myls.ipynb*).

<br>

## Project goals/objectives
  
   - Continue practice writing functions in and using python.  
   - Develop a way to see the output from `dir()` in a more easily readable manner, similar to using `dir()` or `ls()` in R or using `ls` in the unix/linux command line .  
   - Work with/use jupyter notebook(s).  
   - Identify some gaps in my knowledge and proficiency with using python.

## Why this function is handy

The output from the function is presented in an ordered table format. For me, at least, it's easier to read and find a function or attribute in a table than it is when trying to read it in a prose-style format or having to scroll through a long list in a Jupyter Notebook output section.

## Other `ls` style functions/packages that exist

While working on my own function, I researched to see if this functionality had already been developed.  It has. 

Gabriel Reis, a U.K.-based software developer, developed a package called **python-ls**. Information about downloading the package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/python-ls/. Or, you can view his GitHub repository for the package at https://github.com/gabrielcnr/python-ls.

After reading about Mr. Reis's package and reviewing his GitHub repository for the package, I realize that I am not at that skill level yet. However, his files will serve as a good resource to study as I, or you, continue your learning journey.

NOTE: I have not personally downloaded or used the ***python-ls*** package. Therefore, I cannot comment on its features or capabilities.
